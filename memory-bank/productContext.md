## 2. Target Audience & Personas

-   **Persona 1: The Diligent Student (Primary)**
    -   **Needs**: Quick access to definitions, explanations of complex concepts, and evidence-based answers for assignments and exam preparation.
    -   **Pain Points**: Sifting through dense textbooks; finding reliable, up-to-date sources; connecting theoretical knowledge to practical case studies.
    -   **How We Help**: Provides instant, synthesized answers with clear source attribution. The graph-based search helps visualize connections between pathologies, treatments, and anatomical structures.

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1. Agent & Backend
-   **Hybrid Search**: Combines semantic (vector) and graph-based search for comprehensive and contextually relevant results.
-   **Streaming Responses**: Real-time answer generation for an interactive, conversational feel.
-   **Knowledge Graph**: Dynamically builds and queries a Neo4j graph to uncover hidden relationships in the data.
-   **Extensible Toolset**: The agent can be expanded with new tools for different data sources or functionalities.

### 3.2. Modern UI & UX
-   **Interactive Chat Interface**: A familiar, intuitive chat layout with a scrollable message history and a fixed input bar at the bottom, ensuring a seamless user experience.
-   **Dynamic Layout**: A three-column design with a left sidebar for conversation management, a central chat panel, and a right sidebar for displaying dynamic context (e.g., sources, related concepts).
-   **Real-time Feedback**: Visual indicators for connection status, message loading, and streaming responses.
-   **Remote Logging**: A robust, built-in system for capturing frontend logs on the backend, enabling rapid debugging and issue resolution.
